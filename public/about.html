<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi! I’m Samuel, a 17-year-old with a passion for web development and creativity. I love turning ideas into functional and visually appealing websites that help people connect and 
  solve problems. I’m constantly learning new coding languages and experimenting with design techniques to improve my skills. Outside of coding, I enjoy gaming, listening to music, 
  and exploring how tech shapes our world. I’m excited to keep growing as a developer and can’t wait to see where this journey takes me!
